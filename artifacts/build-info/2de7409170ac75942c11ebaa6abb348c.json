See {ERC2771Context}. MinimalForwarder is mainly meant for testing, as it is missing features to be a good production-ready forwarder. This contract does not intend to have all the properties that are needed for a sound forwarding system. A fully functioning forwarding system with good properties requires more complexity. We suggest you look at other projects such as the GSN which do have the goal of building a system like that.\",\"events\":{\"EIP712DomainChanged()\":{\"details\":\"MAY be emitted to signal that the domain could have changed.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"eip712Domain()\":{\"details\":\"See {EIP-5267}. _Available since v4.9._\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/metatx/MinimalForwarder.sol\":\"MinimalForwarder\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC5267.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xac6c2efc64baccbde4904ae18ed45139c9aa8cff96d6888344d1e4d2eb8b659f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6e416a280c610b6b7a5f158e4a41aacfaec01ef14d5d1de13b46be9e090265fc\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmYZP2KrdyccBbhLZT42auhvBTMkwiwUS3V6HWb42rbwbG\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/metatx/MinimalForwarder.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xbf195c64967ca9f9cfba73f699fb67944105dd1976f5da475da18c6dc4f03da2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://8cefe174e4757721ec15e7227adffc809fc375a62ec389d1fb0caa6ea1898444\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmYY6r4ibw8tvi9N8HdrSudNi2Jw45safWvmHXjNoAPHRv\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ShortStrings.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xc0e310c163edf15db45d4ff938113ab357f94fa86e61ea8e790853c4d2e13256\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://04db5bc05dcb05ba1f6ca2dfbead17adc8a2e2f911aa80b05e7a36d9eaf96516\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVkfHZbXVBUPsTopueCn3qGJX8aEjahFF3Fn4NcygLNm5\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf09e68aa0dc6722a25bc46490e8d48ed864466d17313b8a0b254c36b54e49899\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://e26daf81e2252dc1fe1ce0e4b55c2eb7c6d1ee84ae6558d1a9554432ea1d32da\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmb1UANWiWq5pCKbmHSu772hd4nt374dVaghGmwSVNuk8Q\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x3088eb2868e8d13d89d16670b5f8612c4ab9ff8956272837d8e90106c59c14a0\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b81d9ff6559ea5c47fc573e17ece6d9ba5d6839e213e6ebc3b4c5c8fe4199d7f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPCW1bFisUzJkyjroY3yipwfism9RRCigCcK1hbXtVM8n\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x809bc3edb4bcbef8263fa616c1b60ee0004b50a8a1bfa164d8f57fd31f520c58\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://8b93a1e39a4a19eba1600b92c96f435442db88cac91e315c8291547a2a7bcfe2\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmTm34KVe6uZBZwq8dZDNWwPcm24qBJdxqL3rPxBJ4LrMv\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8432884527a7ad91e6eed1cfc5a0811ae2073e5bca107bd0ca442e9236b03dbd\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://e3aa0eadab7aafcf91a95684765f778f64386f0368de88522ce873c21385278a\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPfaVAqWgH1QsT3dHVuL6jwMZbVKdoP8w1PvpiPT2FPWd\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe4455ac1eb7fc497bb7402579e7b4d64d928b846fce7d2b6fde06d366f21c2b3\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://cc8841b3cd48ad125e2f46323c8bad3aa0e88e399ec62acb9e57efa7e7c8058c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmSqE4mXHA2BXW58deDbXE8MTcsL5JSKNDbm23sVQxRLPS\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SignedMath.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf92515413956f529d95977adc9b0567d583c6203fc31ab1c23824c35187e3ddc\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c50fcc459e49a9858b6d8ad5f911295cb7c9ab57567845a250bf0153f84a95c7\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmcEW85JRzvDkQggxiBBLVAasXWdkhEysqypj9EaB6H2g6\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol":{"Context":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data.

The encoding specified in the EIP is very generic, and such a generic implementation in Solidity is not feasible, thus this contract does not implement the encoding itself. Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`. This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA ({_hashTypedDataV4}). The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain. NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \\\"v4\\\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask]. NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the `_domainSeparatorV4` function to always rebuild the separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage. _Available since v3.4._\",\"events\":{\"EIP712DomainChanged()\":{\"details\":\"MAY be emitted to signal that the domain could have changed.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"constructor\":{\"details\":\"Initializes the domain separator and parameter caches.
